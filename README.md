- The key observation is that in order to win Tic-Tac-Toe you must have the entire row or column.
-  Thus, we don't need to keep track of an entire n^2 board. We only need to keep a count for each row and column. 
-  If at any time, a row or column matches the size of the board then that player has won.

## Constraints
- 1 <= moves.length <= 9.
- moves[i].length == 2.
- 0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2.
- Here, are no repeated elements on moves.
